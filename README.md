Overview:

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the probability of a business going bankrupt based on various features. The dataset includes several variables such as industrial risk, management risk, financial flexibility, credibility, competitiveness, operating risk, and the target variable 'class' indicating bankruptcy or non-bankruptcy.

Steps Involved:

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

-Analyze the distribution and summary statistics of each feature.

-Handle missing values and outliers if present.

-Explore relationships between features and the target variable.

Feature Engineering:

Create new features if necessary based on domain knowledge.

Encode categorical variables if any.

Visualization:

Visualize the distribution of features.

Plot correlation matrix to identify relationships between variables.

Explore feature interactions and their impact on the target variable.

Model Building:

Select appropriate machine learning algorithms considering the problem type (classification).

Train multiple models and evaluate their performance using suitable metrics.

Model Training:

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Train the selected model(s) on the training data.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the trained model(s) using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Perform cross-validation to ensure model robustness.

Deployment:

Deploy the trained model using a suitable framework (e.g., Streamlit).

Provide a user-friendly interface for users to input data and get predictions.
